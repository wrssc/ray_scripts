""" Approve Contours and Create TPO

    This script is for physicians to approve their contour set for planning and to
    generate a Treatment Planning Order (TPO) for import into ARIA. As part of TPO
    creation, this script will also add clinical goals and initialize the treatment
    plan(s).

    Finally, dose is computed and then exported after each beamset is created. The DICOM
    export path is set in the configuration settings below. The option to only create
    beams is available by un-checking the "calculate" and "export" runtime options from
    the configuration dialog box.
